# Learning to Use My Ergodox E-Z

## Day One

It arrived on a Friday, and I had guests, so I only started using it at night after they left. Initial enthusiasm gave way to frustration, to dawning realization that I was in for a potentially long period of adjustment. This is my first mechanical keyboard, and I'm already loving the feel of typing on Cherry MX Blues. Tried going back to my membrane keyboard and it just felt... smooshy. So smooshy. 

I realized I have a big project to work on this weekend with some significant code components to it, and that maybe I should hold off on learning a new way to type. 

On second thought... nah. Let's just take the plunge and learn a new way to swim as we go.

## Day Two 

Having blank keycaps isn't a big deal and I'm doing fine learning to use the thumb keys instead of the pinky keys (for enter, backspace, etc). Basically any new key isn't that hard to learn. 

My brain is rebelling HARD against having to type "M" with the index finger on my right hand-- I've always used my middle finger instead, which I suppose is just how I learned. Slightly less rebellion for "V" and "C", which I feel more confident typing, but still goof up on due to muscle memory for the stagger.

My Seasonal Affective Disorder is acting up right now, so I'm not handling stress as well as I could. Maybe not the best time to start learning a new thing and potentially jeopardizing a work project... but w/e. The brain can take one for the team. Again.

Took a nap today and while falling asleep my brain was in anguish over the fact that typing the word "Me" no longer feels like Me because I'm using a different finger... it feels like somebody else. Change is hard!
