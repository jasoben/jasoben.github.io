		<p>It's very simple really as long as you are even mildly comfortable using the command line / terminal. First of all, open a terminal window. Now type the following exactly:</p>
		<blockquote>wget up and go outside</blockquote>
		<p>You move away from the computer and drift outside. Stars are in the sky and you find yourself fixated on a small, dim star right above the treeline. You begin rotating, your body spinning slowly, as slowly as the world spins (were it the size of your body), but your eyes remain fixed on the star. You have to crane your neck, do a backbend even, to stay fixed on the star, the star, the star, as your body turns, it turns, it turns. </p>
		<p>When you go back inside the computer greets you with a prompt:</p>
		<blockquote>Do you want to make a website</blockquote>
		<p>You must tell the truth, as the computer will know at this point. It's eye was the star, and it has seen inside you. You thought it the most important action in the world to keep staring at that star, but really, the computer only wanted you to feel this way so that it could get a good look at you-- all of you.</p>
