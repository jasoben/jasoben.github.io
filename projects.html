					<p>This is a project-based unit on electromagnetism. It optionally uses a die-cutter (e.g. Cricut), but can be done completely by hand as well. Other components can be purchased at a local hardware store.</p>
					<p>The aim was to make a workable DC motor that cost less than a $1.00 in materials.</p>
					<p>The project was successfully tested with a class of middle school students in Charlottesville, VA</p>
